No distraction is a Brave browser extension to block the comment and recommended video sections from displaying when on youtube.

### Why:
I feel these sections are noise and reduce the likelihood of more meaningful thoughts being formed regarding whatever I just watched. 
This is especially problematic on topics which are broken up into many shorter, < 20 min, videos.
